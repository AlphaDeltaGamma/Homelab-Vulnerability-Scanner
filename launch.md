To set up the Virtual Machine (VM) for credential scan, go to VM and open Services.msc. Enable Remote Registry so that the scanner can connect to your computerâ€™s registry and search through the registry for insecure configurations.

Next, we're going to connect to the registry and add a key that is supposed to further disable user account control for the remote account we're going to use it to connect to the compputer during the scan. The value name will be `LocalAccountTicketFilterPolicy` and the value data is set to 1
